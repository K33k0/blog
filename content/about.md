I'm an Epos engineer by trade, which means I repair  electronic equipment in retail shops. Such as tills, servers, printers, etc. When I'm not repairing equipment, I can usually be found sitting behind my computer hacking together SQL queries for the stock management system. If I'm not messing with SQL, I tend to be automating administrative processes using Python or analyzing data in excel.

My blog will cover Epos repairs and the common faults I find  with the accompanying fixes. I will also be including various snippets of code, including excel formulae, SQL snippets, Python functions and whatever else I end up tinkering with.

I may also post about my hobbies from time to time. It's hard to say what exactly they are as they change frequently. Recently I have been painting, drawing, and practising photography.
